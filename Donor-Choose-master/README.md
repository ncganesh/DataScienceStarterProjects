# Donor-Choose 

Problem Statement :

Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

DonorsChoose.org has funded over 1.1 million classroom requests through the support of 3 million donors, the majority of whom were making their first-ever donation to a public school. If DonorsChoose.org can motivate even a fraction of those donors to make another donation, that could have a huge impact on the number of classroom requests fulfilled.

A good solution will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors.

Problem : We need to build a Recommender System so that we can target email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to donors.We need to send Email to donors who has donated only once based on the behavior and past donations.

My Solution to the problem 

1.Exploratory Data Analysis - NLP

2. Identifying the factors influencing project status and Building a Model to predict the projects which will get EXPIRED.

3.Build a Recommender and Suggesting only the  Expired projects to specific donors
